# Natural Language Processing Coursework

## Part One — Syntax and Style
In the first part of your coursework, your task is to explore the syntax and style of a set of
19th Century novels using the methods and tools that you learned in class.
The texts you need for this part are in the novels subdirectory of the texts directory
in the coursework Moodle template. The texts are in plain text files, and the filenames
include the title, author, and year of publication, separated by hyphens. The template code
provided in PartOne.py includes function headers for some sub-parts of this question. The
main method of your finished script should call each of these functions in order. To complete
your coursework, complete these functions so that they perform the tasks specified in the
questions below. You may (and in some cases should) define additional functions

## Part Two — Feature Extraction and Classification
In the second part of the coursework, your task is to train and test machine learning classifiers
on a dataset of political speeches. The objective is to learn to predict the political party from
the text of the speech. The texts you need for this part are in the speeches sub-directory
of the texts directory of the coursework Moodle template. For this part, you can structure
your python functions in any way that you like, but pay attention to exactly what information
(if any) you are asked to print out in each part. Your final script should print out the answers
to each part where required, and nothing else
